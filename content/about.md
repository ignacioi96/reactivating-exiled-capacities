## Why Reactivating Exiled Capacities?

**Reactivating Exiled Capacities is an inquiry** about listening with more honesty, sensing what has been **fragmented** but not erased, and making space for its return. **This is not a comfortable path. It is one that requires us to sit with what we don't want to know about ourselves—the ways we have been trained to numb and invest in our own disconnection.**

The Reactivating Exiled Capacities (REC) project emerges as a humble inquiry into the roots of our meta-crisis. Rather than offering surface-level solutions or perpetuating a cycle of quick fixes, REC seeks to address the deeply entrenched patterns of thought, emotion, and relation that sustain harm in the colonial systems we live in.

Anchored in the teachings of the [Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures (GTDF) collective](https://decolonialfutures.net/), this project invites participants to explore how colonialism manifests not only in geopolitical systems and historical injustices but also in intimate, molecular, and embodied ways. Generally, in education, we attempt to conceptualize the problem as one of 'ignorance' by providing 'more knowledge' —operating under the assumption that if people only knew the truth about [x], they would change their behavior. However, we have come to realize that our current metacrisis is not a challenge of ignorance but one of unconscious denial. When these denials are confronted, they are often met with anger and defensiveness, as they threaten our sense of identity, safety, and control. One way to compost through our collective denials we must engage with the emotional, relational, and systemic forces that uphold and reward these denials in the first place.

REC is a limited attempt to unwire those denials through artistic, somatic and metaphorical technologies by nurturing the recovery of relational sensibilities and capacities that have been exiled from our bodies by colonial-modern frameworks. This exile permeates the psycho-affective body, the nervous system, the collective epistemic body, and our socio-political structures, which we understand as larger shared bodies.

## What Are Exiled Capacities?

Exiled Capacities are dispositions or sensibilities that have been exiled from the (collective) body by the systems of modernity we live in. For example, the capacity to be present to the complex reality of things - the beautiful, the ugly, the broken and the messed up within and around us, as opposed to escaping what is difficult, painful or disgusting or being attached to idealized versions of reality and of ourselves. Or, the capacity to enact visceral accountability and put oneself in service without needing to be remembered for that service; this requires the disposition to face responsibilities without excuse, doing what is needed even if it goes against one's self-interest.

At its core, REC is an invitation to practice capacities for relationality, care, and accountability that have been displaced by systems of separability. These systems, which prioritize individualism and commodification have shaped our neurophysiology, our ways of being, and our interactions with the earth. It asks the question: How have we been trained to numb ourselves to the costs of our comfort? What we call "personal choice" or "individual freedom" often relies on unseen relational debts—harm displaced onto other bodies, other lands, other times.

What have you been conditioned to avoid? What would it ask of you to stay present with discomfort instead of moving past it?

Exiled capacities are not lost forever, but reactivating them requires practices that extend beyond intellectual comprehension. We invite a form of knowing that is not just cognitive, but meta-epistemic—one that recognizes partiality, contradiction, and the limits of human understanding. This means holding space for multiple truths, even when they appear contradictory, and listening beyond words. This means recognizing that sensory, embodied, and ancestral knowledge are not in opposition to scientific or conceptual frameworks, but in conversation with them.

In a sense, reactivating these exiled capacities is like tending to a relationship over time: it deepens and gains nuance as we tend to it. Most of these capacities live in the embodied layers of our existence, in how we respond to complexity, and in how we care for the entangled web of life we are part of. REC is one attempt among many to support this reactivation, a modest contribution to a larger field of efforts seeking to interrupt the patterns of separability that sustain harm.

## Relationship to Art and Language: An Aesthetics of Listening

The somatic invitations from this inquiry are not performances or artworks in the traditional sense, because REC approaches art not as object, vehicle for content, or product—but as an ecology of living practices.

These practices engage with art not in the service of representation, but as invitation: to feel, to unlearn, to stay with what resists resolution. Artistic practice becomes a relational technology for tuning perception, disrupting conditioned habits of attention, and composting the logics of control, purity, and separability that underlie colonial modernity.

This approach has profound implications for how we relate to language.

Since the reactivation of exiled capacities is not an informational problem, language is not used here as a carrier of fixed concepts. Within REC, language becomes a proxy for sensibilities—a vibrational field rather than a tool of transmission.

As you move through this website, you will encounter different proxy-languages—words that attempt to approximate the vibrational field we seek to nurture. Yet it is crucial to release the expectation that these proxy-languages serve as encyclopedic agents. These words are not definitions: they are suggestions, approximations, pointers, and guides.

This reframing of art and language is an aesthetics of listening—not listening for answers, but listening with frequencies.

We invite those who engage with these invitations to approach them as they would a piece of music, or a shift in temperature. Let it move you, stretch you, blur your boundaries. Let meaning hover at the edges of sensation.
