In 2024, a digital art residency was hosted with several artists from diverse artistic practices, geographical locations, and ancestral heritages. It was a shared space to experiment with the reactivation of capacities that have been exiled through colonial modernity: sensibilities for relationality, care, accountability, and complexity.

To enter this inquiry, each artist first participated in the Facing Human Wrongs course, which invited them to confront their complicity in systems of harm, to feel the grief and contradictions that arise, and to sit with discomfort without rushing to solutions. From this ground, the artists created artistic, somatic, and metaphorical invitationsâ€”experiments designed to nurture relational sensibilities and cultivate the capacity to stay with complexity.

These invitations offer ways to interrupt conditioned desires for comfort, certainty, and control, and to reawaken the embodied wisdom that colonial modernity has tried to sever.
