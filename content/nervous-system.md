## The Nervous System as Relational Fabric

### Polyvagal Theory and the Nervous System: A Thread of Connection

Within REC we are inviting an understanding of the nervous system as a continuous network of communication between what we conceptualize as the human body, mind, and the rest of nature. While modern frameworks often treat these domains as separate, we see them as deeply intertwined, forming a dynamic whole. Our nervous system reflects and interacts with relational and ecological systems, serving as a thread that weaves together the personal, collective, and planetary dimensions of our existence.

Polyvagal Theory, developed by Stephen Porges, offers a nuanced lens for understanding how our autonomic nervous system responds to stress, safety, and connection. It identifies three intertwined circuits:

- **Dorsal Vagal Complex**: Governs immobilization responses like fainting or shutdown.
- **Sympathetic Nervous System**: Drives mobilization responses such as fight or flight.
- **Ventral Vagal Complex**: Facilitates social engagement, calm, and connection.

These circuits help us map how our nervous systems react to stress and regulate states of being, whether through retreating, defending, or connecting. However, Polyvagal Theory often reflects modernity's emphasis on individual regulation, overlooking the ways our nervous systems are entangled with broader relational and ecological networks. Expanding this perspective is essential for addressing the polycrisis.

Not in an abstract way—scan your shoulders, your jaw, your belly. What happens when you bring your attention there? Does it shift, resist, settle?
</div>

### Mapping Individual Survival and Resilience Responses

The chart below illustrates how these circuits influence individual survival and resilience responses, highlighting the interplay between physiology, emotional states, and cognitive capacities. However, this framework often centers individual regulation, reflecting modernity's orientation toward separability. Expanding this lens requires reimagining the nervous system as entangled—not just within the individual body but also with the collective, ecological, and temporal webs of life.

| Nervous System Circuit | Survival State | Physiological Effects | Emotional Effects | Cognitive Effects | Common reactions |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Dorsal Vagal Complex | Immobilization (Freeze/Faint) | Shutdown, low energy | Numbness, despair | Difficulty processing | Withdrawal/avoidance/denials |
| Sympathetic Nervous System | Mobilization (Fight/Flight) | Increased energy, tension | Anxiety, fear, anger | Reactive, short-term thinking | Attack others/attack self/denials |
| Ventral Vagal Complex | Social Engagement | Relaxed, calm, alert | Safety, connection | Open, collaborative thinking | Ability to hold compassion and complexity/work through conflict |

### Our nervous systems within the meta- perma- poly- crisis

The polycrisis triggers nervous system responses rooted in survival, often cycling through fight, flight, freeze, faint, or fix. These reactions are shaped by modernity's emphasis on control, consumption, and disconnection, leading to patterns of avoidance or oversimplified solutions. The chart below illustrates how these survival states manifest in societal responses:

| Nervous System Circuit | Survival State | Response Pattern | Examples in the Polycrisis |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Sympathetic Nervous System | Fight | Confrontation and domination | Exploiting resources further to "win" against environmental collapse; increasing militarization and policing borders when facing the climate refugee crisis; scapegoating vulnerable populations and perpetuating racism. |
| Sympathetic Nervous System | Flight | Avoidance and escape | Fleeing to ideologies of techno-utopia; disengaging from responsibility by retreating into individualism or apathy. |
| Dorsal Vagal Complex | Freeze | Immobilization and paralysis | Feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed by the scale of the crises; resorting to denial or falling into nihilism or hopelessness. |
| Dorsal Vagal Complex | Faint | Collapse and numbing | Seeking solace in consumerism, addiction, or escapism to avoid facing uncomfortable realities. |
| Sympathetic Nervous System | Fix | Oversimplified problem-solving | Proposing quick fixes like carbon credits, green capitalism, and green-energy solutions that rely on exploitation and extraction; geoengineering as a technological "solution." |

## Neuro-Colonization and Neuro-Decolonization: Reclaiming the Entangled Nervous System

Chief Ninawa Huni Kui, an Indigenous leader from the Huni Kui community in the Amazon and co-researcher in the GTDF collective, describes separability as a "metabolic dis-ease"—a condition that fractures our sense of identity and leaves us insecure, seeking superiority to mask this insecurity. This dis-ease operates at the level of neurobiology, shaping our fears, desires, and relational patterns. It drives the systems of cultural supremacy, ecological destruction, and exploitation that are at the root of our crises.

Colonial-modern systems have conditioned our nervous systems to prioritize separability, shaping physiological, emotional, and relational patterns that perpetuate harm. This phenomenon, which we call neuro-colonization, systematically wires our nervous systems to favor control, fear, and disconnection. It reinforces survival-based responses like fight, flight, freeze, and faint, making us less capable of engaging with complexity and interdependence.

Neuro-decolonization is a concept developed by Cree elder Dr. Cash Ahenakew that refers to unwiring these harmful attachments and reclaiming an entangled nervous system—one attuned to and guided by collective and metabolic processes. This involves reactivating capacities for relational intelligence, intergenerational accountability, and ecological attunement. It is a shift from survival-based, individualistic regulation toward a relational embodiment of shared rhythms and responsibilities.

Relationality does only operate in spatial dimensions, it is also temporal. In the practice of REC we invite a meta-scalar awareness: How do the traumas and wisdoms of past generations shape the present? How might today's choices ripple through future generations and ecosystems? Can the future be pulling us toward it, guiding us into repair? And perhaps most provocatively—Can our actions in the present reverberate backward, altering the motion of the past—not to erase it, but to transform its resonance?

### Mapping Polyvagal Theory to an Entangled Paradigm

To address the limitations of Polyvagal Theory when applied to the polycrisis, REC proposes an expanded view—one that acknowledges our nervous systems as entangled with the relational, ecological, and temporal processes that sustain life. It also invites a meta-affective disposition. To engage meta-affectively is to hold space for pain—not as something to escape or fix, but as a teacher. Pain reveals the threads of connection that have been strained or broken. Modernity isolates us in these wounds, framing them as private failures rather than collective fractures. Meta-affective awareness invites us to re-enter the fullness of feeling without fear or shame, so that pain may be metabolized rather than suppressed. This reimagining moves us beyond survival responses rooted in individualism toward collective and systemic resilience.

The chart below offers an entry point into this inquiry:

| Usual Nervous System State | Focus | Entangled Response | Implications for Relationality |
|----------------------------|-------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Fight | Survival/self | Surrender without collapsing: Accountability | Acknowledging complicity |
| Flight | Avoidance/self | Attunement | Staying with discomfort |
| Freeze | (Paralysis)/self | Movement | Relating generatively to failure |
| Faint | (Collapse)/self | Nurturing | Shifting our relationship to hope and imagination |
| Fix | (Control)/self | Composting | Letting go of unsustainable patterns of thinking, being and relating |

### Shifting Toward Responsible and Relational Responses

To respond to the polycrisis with care and accountability, we must move beyond survival states into resilient states. The chart below maps these shifts:

| Survival State (separability) | Entangled State | Nervous System Circuit | Examples of Relational Responses |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Fight (Survival) | Surrender without collapsing: Accountability | Entangled Ventral Vagal Complex | A call for humility: Acknowledging complicity with harm and sitting with discomfort. Engage with the difficult truths about harm and complicity rather than rushing to solutions. Create spaces for collective reckoning, foster humility, and a willingness to hold the discomfort of shared responsibility. |
| Flight (Avoidance) | Attuning: staying with the trouble | Entangled Ventral Vagal Complex | Developing practices for deep listening to relational and ecological vibrations; attuning to different scales of experience—personal, collective, and planetary. Acknowledge where avoidance has been a default response and commit to staying present and curious instead of avoiding complicity. |
| Freeze (Paralysis) | Moving | Entangled Ventral Vagal Complex | Focusing on small, relational actions that build trust; using body-based practices to awaken movement and responsiveness; co-creating incremental steps toward change. Focus on new mistakes and failure as a generative practice. Shift from paralysis to co-created action, recognizing the value of imperfection in initial steps. |
| Faint (Collapse) | Nurturing | Dorsal and Ventral Vagal Integration | Co-creating rituals of care that acknowledge shared vulnerability and interdependence; building restorative practices for mutual repair and ecological healing. Ground relational care in reciprocity rather than transactionalism, saviorism or escapism. |
| Fix (Control) | Composting | Sympathetic/Ventral Vagal Coordination | Supporting collective processes of letting go—whether of harmful systems, outdated beliefs, or unsustainable practices. Foster spaces for emergent, adaptive possibilities. Acknowledge the value of decay as part of regeneration, rather than forcing premature resolutions. |

The approach we are suggesting is one where the nervous system is not just a site of individual regulation but a relational and collective thread that connects us to the larger web of life. In this context, the capacity for meta-regulation emerges as a vital yet often exiled ability. Meta-regulation involves three interconnected layers: self-regulation, co-regulation, and meta-regulation, each expanding the nervous system's capacity to engage with complexity, ambiguity, and interdependence.
