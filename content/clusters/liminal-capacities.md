title: "Liminal Capacities"
description: "The art of dwelling in thresholds—between endings and beginnings, certainty and mystery, breakdown and emergence."
why_matters: "Modernity denies liminal space. It rushes to resolution, treats grief as something to manage or overcome, and numbs collective pain into individualized pathology. This leaves us ill-equipped to feel what must be felt, to metabolize the systemic denial of pain, or to process the emotional fields that arise in times of transition and collapse. These capacities allow us to stay with the field long enough to grieve collectively, to compost what's dissolving, and to invite what's emerging without forcing it."

  - title: "Humor as Rupture"
    subtitle: "Laughter as a crack in the wall of authority"
    what_it_is: "Humor as release and rupture. As a crack in the wall of authority, unrestricted autonomy, arbitration, affirmation. Clowning as a practice reminds us that we are not the center, that our need for righteousness, certainty, looking good, is part of the disease. This is the work of humor as humility—the capacity to fumble publicly and to openly and honestly look at our addictions to superiority in order to let failure become relational compost. When the clown stumbles, when we laugh at her, we are laughing at our own illusions—the part of us addicted to control, coherence, and exceptionalism."
    why_exiled: "Modernity treats failure as shame and humor as distraction—because both threaten the fragile scaffolding of superiority."
    what_possible: "Humor as humility allows us to compost these addictions. It makes room for failure without collapse, for truth without control, for presence without performance. It loosens the tapeworm's grip—not through force, but through laughter."

  - title: "Staying with(in) Emergence - 'Azar'"
    subtitle: "Dancing with chance, randomness, the unknown"
    what_it_is: "This capacity is an invitation to walk the tightrope between naive hope and desperate hopelessness—which are both expressions of certainty addiction—ways of trying to predict or control what's to come. But Azar—chance, randomness, emergence—has no allegiance to certainty. Azar is the spirit of the unknown. The fool walks into the scene without a script. Play is not a distraction—it's a relational practice with the unknown. Dancing with Azar is the capacity to stay with emergence—to feel the field shifting, to invite chance in, to let randomness be a co-facilitator."
    why_exiled: "Modernity demands predictability, control, and strategic certainty. Emergence threatens planning, efficiency, and the illusion of mastery over outcomes."
    what_possible: "Dancing with Azar lets experimentation return—not through rigid strategy, but through relational improvisation. It brings curiosity back into the room and allows for genuine co-creation with the unknown."
    distortions:
      - name: "Spiritual bypassing"
        description: "Using 'trust in emergence' to avoid necessary planning, accountability, or difficult decisions."
      - name: "Chaos addiction"
        description: "Creating unnecessary disruption or unpredictability as a way to avoid deeper engagement with what's actually emerging."

  - title: "Inhabiting Liminality"
    subtitle: "Dwelling in the space between endings and beginnings"
    what_it_is: "To inhabit liminality is to dwell in the space between endings and beginnings, where nothing feels certain, where identities dissolve but have not yet reformed. This space is often thick with feeling—not just personal emotions, but meta-affective landscapes: the collective weight of grief, longing, anger, emptiness, and the awe that flickers through even in the fog. This capacity asks: Can you stay in the fog? Can you hold the weight of the field without rushing to rebuild identity or make meaning? Can you listen to grief as a teacher, without needing to fix it or flee?"
    why_exiled: "Modernity denies liminal space. It rushes to resolution, treats grief as something to manage or overcome, and numbs collective pain into individualized pathology. This leaves us ill-equipped to feel what must be felt, to metabolize the systemic denial of pain, or to process the emotional fields that arise in times of transition and collapse."
    what_possible: "Reclaiming Inhabiting Liminality allows us to stay with the field long enough to grieve collectively, to compost what's dissolving, and to invite what's emerging without forcing it. It's the capacity to be interrupted by the full spectrum of feeling, and to respond with attuned care, knowing that collective hearts can hold what individual hearts cannot."

      - name: "Liminal addiction"
        description: "Getting stuck in the threshold as a way to avoid commitment, responsibility, or the work of emergence."
      - name: "Emotional bypassing"
        description: "Using the language of 'collective grief' to avoid personal accountability or specific relational repair."
