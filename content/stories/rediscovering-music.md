For twenty-three years, I didn't touch a pian

![]()

o. 

What had once been the center of my world—hours spent at the keys, composing melodies that seemed to flow from somewhere beyond myself—had become a source of pain. A harsh critique from a music teacher during my college years had effectively silenced not just my playing, but my belief that I had any musical capacity worth nurturing.

"You lack the natural talent for serious music," she had said. "Perhaps you should consider a more practical major."

Those words had the power to exile an entire part of myself. I switched majors, graduated with a business degree, and built a successful career in marketing. But there was always something missing—a creative emptiness that I learned to ignore, to push down, to forget.

## The Chance Encounter

Last spring, while helping my elderly neighbor move to assisted living, I found myself alone with her old upright piano. She had asked me to arrange for its donation, but as I stood there running my fingers along its dusty keys, something stirred.

Almost without conscious thought, my fingers found their way to a simple C major scale. The muscle memory was still there, dormant but intact, like a language I thought I had forgotten but could suddenly speak again.

## The First Tentative Steps

That evening, I couldn't stop thinking about the piano. I called my neighbor and asked if I could sit with it for a few minutes before the donation truck arrived. She smiled and handed me the key.

I started with scales—C major, G major, F major. My fingers were stiff, unfamiliar with the stretches they once knew so well. But slowly, carefully, I began to remember. Not just the technical aspects, but the feeling—the way music could move through me, the joy of creation, the sense of connecting with something larger than myself.

## Reclaiming the Capacity

Three weeks later, I purchased that piano from my neighbor. It now sits in my living room, no longer just a piece of furniture but a portal back to a part of myself I thought was lost.

The reactivation hasn't been linear. Some days, my fingers remember complex pieces I learned decades ago. Other days, I struggle with simple exercises. But what's different now is my relationship with the struggle itself. Where once I heard that teacher's voice telling me I lacked talent, I now hear my own voice, gentler and more patient, reminding me that capacity isn't about perfection—it's about connection, expression, and joy.

## What I've Learned

Reactivating this musical capacity has taught me several important things:

**Exile isn't always permanent.** What we set aside can often be reclaimed, even after decades.

**Muscle memory extends beyond the physical.** My fingers remembered the keys, but more importantly, my heart remembered why I loved music in the first place.

**Criticism that creates exile often says more about the critic than the criticized.** That teacher's harsh words reflected her own limitations, not mine.

**Reactivation requires both courage and patience.** It took courage to sit down at that piano again, and it takes ongoing patience to rebuild what was lost.

**The capacity returns different than it left.** I'm not the same musician I was at nineteen, and that's actually a gift. I bring to the piano now a lifetime of experiences, emotions, and perspectives that make my music richer, even if technically it may be less polished.

## The Ongoing Journey

Six months later, I play almost every day. I've started taking lessons again—this time with a teacher who understands that music is about expression, not just technical perfection. I've even begun composing again, creating simple pieces that capture moments of joy, reflection, and discovery.

The musical capacity that was exiled for over two decades has not just returned—it has evolved. It's no longer the anxious, performance-focused musicality of my youth, but something more grounded, more personally meaningful, more truly mine.

Sometimes I wonder about other capacities that might be waiting in exile, ready to be reactivated when the time is right. But for now, I'm content to sit at my piano each evening, fingers moving across keys that feel like coming home, grateful for the reminder that it's never too late to reclaim the parts of ourselves we thought were lost forever.
